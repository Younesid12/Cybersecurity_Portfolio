What I Learned

Cybersecurity means protecting computers, networks, and data from attacks.

It is important because many people and companies face threats every day.

There are different types of cyber attacks, such as:

Phishing (tricking people into giving information)

Malware (harmful software)

Ransomware (locking files until money is paid)

Social engineering (manipulating people)

DDoS attacks (overloading a system)

I learned the CIA Triad, which guides all cybersecurity work:

Confidentiality – keeping information private

Integrity – keeping information accurate

Availability – keeping systems accessible

I learned what threats, vulnerabilities, and risks mean and how they relate to attacks.

Cybersecurity has many career paths, such as SOC analyst, penetration tester, red teamer, and security engineer.

Cyber attacks happen because systems have weaknesses or because people can be tricked.

Cybersecurity professionals work to prevent attacks, detect them, and protect systems.

This room gave me a simple, clear foundation to continue my cybersecurity journey.
