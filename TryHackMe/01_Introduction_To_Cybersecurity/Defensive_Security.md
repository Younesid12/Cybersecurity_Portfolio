Defensive Security 🛡️💻
In this module, I explored Defensive Security, which taught me how to protect systems, networks, and data from attacks.
While offensive security focuses on finding weaknesses, defensive security is all about prevention, detection, and response to keep information safe.

🎯 Key Roles I Learned About:
Security Analyst – I monitor systems and networks to detect threats.

SOC Analyst – I respond to security incidents and investigate alerts.

Security Engineer – I design and implement security measures to prevent attacks.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques I Explored:
Firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) – monitoring and blocking malicious activity.

Patch Management – keeping systems updated to prevent vulnerabilities.

Antivirus & Endpoint Security – protecting devices from malware.

Log Analysis & Threat Monitoring – detecting suspicious activity early.

🧠 Defensive Mindset:
I learned that defensive security requires:

Attention to Detail – carefully monitoring systems to spot threats.

Proactive Thinking – anticipating attacks before they happen.

Quick Response – reacting fast to prevent or limit damage.
