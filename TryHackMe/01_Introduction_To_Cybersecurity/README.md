This folder contains my notes from the “Introduction to Cybersecurity” room on TryHackMe. In this room, I learned what cybersecurity is and why it is important for protecting computers, networks, and data.
I discovered different types of attacks like phishing, malware, and ransomware. I also learned simple concepts like threats, vulnerabilities, and risk.
This room gave me a basic understanding of how cyber attacks happen and what cybersecurity professionals do, helping me start my learning journey with confidence.
