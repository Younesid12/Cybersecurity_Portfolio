Offensive Security 💻🛡️

I explored Offensive Security, which taught me how to think like an attacker to find weaknesses in systems before they can be exploited. This approach helps me understand how attacks happen and how to defend systems effectively.

🎯 Key Roles I Learned About

Penetration Tester – I simulate attacks to identify system weaknesses and report them.

Red Teamer – I emulate real-world attacks to test defenses and improve security.

Security Engineer – I help design and maintain secure systems to prevent breaches.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques I Explored

Scanning & Enumeration – discovering system details and possible entry points.

Exploitation – safely testing vulnerabilities to see how attackers could exploit them.

Reporting – documenting findings with clear explanations and recommendations.

🧠 The Attacker Mindset

I learned that offensive security requires:

Creativity – finding hidden weaknesses that are not obvious.

Patience & Persistence – carefully testing systems without giving up.

Attention to Detail – ensuring no risk or vulnerability is missed.
