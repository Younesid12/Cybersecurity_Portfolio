Offensive Security – What I Learned 💻🛡️
In this module, I explored Offensive Security and learned how to think like an attacker to find weaknesses in systems before they can be exploited. This approach helps me understand how organizations stay secure and why identifying vulnerabilities is so important.

Key Roles I Learned About 🎯
Penetration Tester – I simulate attacks on systems to find weaknesses and report them.

Red Teamer – I emulate real-world attacks to test the strength of defenses.

Security Engineer – I help design and maintain systems to make them secure.

Tools & Techniques I Explored 🛠️
Scanning & Enumeration – discovering system details.

Exploitation – testing vulnerabilities safely.

Reporting – documenting findings with clear explanations and recommendations.

The Attacker Mindset 🧠
I learned that offensive security requires:

Creativity – finding hidden weaknesses.

Patience & Persistence – staying focused while testing systems.

Attention to Detail – ensuring no risk is overlooked.
By learning offensive security, I now understand how attacks happen and how defenders can protect systems better.
It showed me that cybersecurity is not just defense—it’s about knowing the attack side to stay ahead. This knowledge gives me a strong foundation to continue my journey in cybersecurity and grow my skills further.
